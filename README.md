## JS Introductory Unit test exercise (deadline July 25)

* Clone the [Frontend Training repository](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-training).
* Look at the existing examples for tests in [`fun.test.ts`](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-training/blob/master/exercises/minesweeper/react-minesweeper/src/fun.test.ts).
  - Implement a suite of tests that would describe the expected behavior for the `stateAfterClick` function. Describe how state should update when user clicks on fields with 0 bombs around them, where surrounding fields should be revealed automatically.
  - Improve the implementation of `stateAfterClick` function ensuring that your tests pass.
