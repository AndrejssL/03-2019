## JS Introductory Unit test exercise (deadline July 25)

* Clone the [Frontend Training repository](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-training).
* Look at the existing examples for tests in [`fun.test.ts`](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-training/blob/master/exercises/minesweeper/react-minesweeper/src/fun.test.ts).
  - Implement a suite of tests that would describe the expected behavior for the `stateAfterClick` function. Describe how state should update when user clicks on fields with 0 bombs around them, where surrounding fields should be revealed automatically.
  - Improve the implementation of `stateAfterClick` function ensuring that your tests pass.

## JS Classes & Objects exercises (deadline August 3rd)

* Complete [Exercise #4](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-syllabus/tree/master/js-basics/exercises#exercise-4) together with working unit test and add it to your *js-exercises* repository under medium exercises;
* Complete [Video Store](https://github.com/codelex-io/javascript-exercises/tree/master/src/exercises/oop/video-store) in your repository;
* **Give me more!** - complete [Flight Planner](https://github.com/codelex-io/frontend-syllabus/tree/master/js-basics/exercises#exercise-6) in your repository.

Complete the tasks in a new branch called `classes-and-objects` and create PR to your teacher.
